# NowYou-reTalking
Social media with a positive purpose 

Social media tells us what we want to hear. More and more we keep getting fed our own opinions. Its really no wonder people are becoming increasingly stubborn, and our world becomes more polorized.

Now You're Talking is my solution to this. The goal of this app is to take trending controversial topics and get a group of people who disagree to talk about it.

This shall be achieved by pulling trending topics from the web and placing those topics on a easy to view list that users can then click through.

Once a topic has been clicked users are sent to the discussion page where they can vote their openion on the topic or click one of the more information links that redirects them to a reputable source on the topic. After the user has submitted their openion they are then placed in a group of other people that agree and disagree with them. Groups shall be determined by the percentage of people that believe something.

Users shall also be able to follow a topic by clicking the favorites button which will save the topic in the topic to the User favorites page.

Always looking for contributors, lets make something that changes the world.
